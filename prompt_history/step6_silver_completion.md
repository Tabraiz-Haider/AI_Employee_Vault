**Date:** February 18, 2026
**Author:** Tabraiz Haider

## Prompt Given

> Create a script `linkedin_agent.py` that drafts a professional LinkedIn post about Multicraft Agency or Lyvexa AI services, saving the draft to `Drafts/LinkedIn_Post.md`.
>
> Update `agent_brain.py` so that when it detects a HIGH priority task, it also creates a `Plan.md` file in the `/Plans` folder, detailing how to solve that task.
>
> Log this as `step6_silver_completion.md` in `prompt_history`.

## What Was Built

### 1. LinkedIn Agent (`linkedin_agent.py`)

A post-draft generator that creates professional LinkedIn content for two brands.

#### Features
- **Two brand profiles:** Multicraft Agency and Lyvexa AI, each with their own tagline, service catalog, and call-to-action
- **CLI flags:**
  - Default: generates a Multicraft Agency post
  - `--lyvexa`: generates a Lyvexa AI post
  - `--both`: generates drafts for both brands
  - Custom topic: `python linkedin_agent.py "Our new AI dashboard"`
- **Output:** Timestamped markdown files in `Drafts/`
- **Post structure:** Hook line, service list, CTA, hashtags, review reminder

#### Generated Files
```
Drafts/
├── LinkedIn_Post_multicraft_agency_20260218_021858.md
└── LinkedIn_Post_lyvexa_ai_20260218_021858.md
```

#### Sample Output (Lyvexa AI)
```markdown

### 2. Agent Brain Update — Execution Plans

`agent_brain.py` now generates both a Task file AND a Plan file for every HIGH priority item.

#### New: `Plans/` Folder

Each plan file contains:
- **Objective:** One-line goal derived from the action hint
- **Context:** Original briefing action + email summary
- **Step-by-Step Plan:** 4-5 actionable steps tailored to the specific task type
- **Success Criteria:** Checkboxes for completion tracking

#### Plan Templates (keyword-matched)

| Keyword | Plan Focus |
|---------|-----------|
| `connect` | LinkedIn invitation review, profile assessment, accept/decline workflow |
| `cart` | E-commerce cart evaluation, purchase/abandon decision |
| `ramadan` | Time-sensitive event assessment, participation decision |
| `order` | Order review, payment/cancellation workflow |
| (fallback) | Generic 5-step review-decide-execute plan |

#### Generated Plan Files
```
Plans/
├── PLAN_I_want_to_connect.md
├── PLAN_Something_special_is_coming_this_Ramadan!.md
└── PLAN_Your_cart's_rolling_away._Complete_your_order_today.md
```

#### Execution Output
```
[02:19:42] Scanning for HIGH priority items...
  [SCAN] Found 3 HIGH priority items in CEO Briefing
  [SCAN] Loaded 10 emails from Readings/
  [PLAN]  PLAN_I_want_to_connect.md
  [PLAN]  PLAN_Something_special_is_coming_this_Ramadan!.md
  [PLAN]  PLAN_Your_cart's_rolling_away._Complete_your_order_today.md
  [DONE] Tasks: 0 | Plans: 3
```

(Tasks showed 0 because they were already created in Step 4. Plans were new.)

## How to Run

```bash
# LinkedIn Agent
python linkedin_agent.py              # Multicraft Agency draft
python linkedin_agent.py --lyvexa     # Lyvexa AI draft
python linkedin_agent.py --both       # Both brands

# Agent Brain (now creates Tasks + Plans)
python agent_brain.py --once          # Single scan
python agent_brain.py                 # Continuous loop (every 5 min)
```

---

## Architecture Significance

With this step, the AI Employee now has three autonomous capabilities:

1. **Perceive** — Gmail Bridge + Desktop Watcher (senses)
2. **Reason & Plan** — Agent Brain detects priorities AND generates execution plans
3. **Draft & Communicate** — LinkedIn Agent creates professional content

This completes the Silver Tier requirements and sets the foundation for the Platinum Tier.

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.13
- `pathlib` for cross-platform paths
- `re` (regex) for markdown parsing
- Keyword-based template engine for plans and action hints
- CLI argument parsing via `sys.argv`

---

## Status

Complete. Silver Tier requirements fulfilled. LinkedIn drafts generated. Execution plans auto-created for all 3 HIGH priority items.
