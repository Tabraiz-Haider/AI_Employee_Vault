# Step 15 — Platinum Action Execution

**Date:** 2026-02-18
**Tier:** Platinum
**Status:** Implemented

## Summary

Added browser automation to execute actions that were previously draft-only.
The vault can now post LinkedIn drafts and send WhatsApp messages through
Playwright-controlled Chrome sessions.

## Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `linkedin_poster.py` | Posts the latest LinkedIn draft via Playwright browser automation |
| `whatsapp_sender.py` | Sends approved WhatsApp messages via WhatsApp Web |

## Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `app.py` | Added "Execute All Approved" button in Agent Settings sidebar |
| `vault_sync.py` | Added `Approved/` to WORKFLOW_DIRS |

## Architecture

```
Drafts/LinkedIn_Post*.md  -->  linkedin_poster.py  -->  LinkedIn Feed
Approved/*.md             -->  whatsapp_sender.py  -->  WhatsApp Web  -->  Done/
Dashboard button          -->  subprocess.run()    -->  Both scripts
```

## Dependencies

- `playwright` — browser automation (`pip install playwright && playwright install chromium`)
- Persistent Chrome profile at `C:\Users\Tabraiz Haider\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data`
- Chrome must be fully closed before running (profile lock)
- User must be logged into LinkedIn and WhatsApp Web in Chrome

## Usage

```bash
# Post latest LinkedIn draft
python linkedin_poster.py

# Post a specific draft
python linkedin_poster.py Drafts/LinkedIn_Post_multicraft_agency_20260218_042249.md

# Send all approved WhatsApp messages
python whatsapp_sender.py

# Watch mode — polls every 60s
python whatsapp_sender.py --watch
```

## Approved File Format (WhatsApp)

```markdown
**To:** Contact Name

## Message
Your message body here.
Multiple lines supported.
```

## Notes

- Browser automation is inherently fragile. LinkedIn and WhatsApp update their DOM frequently.
- Scripts use `headless=False` so the user can observe and intervene.
- Selectors may need periodic updates as platforms change their UI.
