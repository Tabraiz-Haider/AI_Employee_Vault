# Step 1 — Silver Tier: Gmail Bridge & Automated Email Intelligence

**Date:** February 17, 2026
**Tier:** Silver
**Author:** Tabraiz Haider
**Project:** GIAIC Hackathon 0 — Personal AI Employee

---

## Objective

Integrate Gmail API as a real-time data source so the AI Employee can autonomously fetch, parse, and store email summaries in the Obsidian vault — enabling the "Monday Morning CEO Briefing" workflow.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Gmail Bridge (`watchers/gmail_bridge.py`)

A full-featured Gmail watcher that authenticates via OAuth2, fetches unread emails, and saves structured Markdown summaries into `Readings/`.

**Core components:**

#### Authentication Flow
- Uses Google OAuth2 with `InstalledAppFlow`
- Scopes: `gmail.readonly` (read-only access)
- First run opens browser for Google sign-in on `localhost:8090`
- Stores `token.json` for subsequent runs (auto-refreshes expired tokens)
- Requires `credentials.json` from Google Cloud Console

#### Email Fetching
- Queries Gmail for `is:unread` messages
- Fetches up to 10 emails per poll (`MAX_EMAILS = 10`)
- Extracts metadata headers: `Subject`, `From`, `Date`
- Captures Gmail `snippet` as the email summary

#### Markdown Output
Each email is saved as an individual Markdown file in `Readings/`:

```
Readings/
├── EMAIL_19c68c55290eb40f.md
├── EMAIL_19c68962c0be30ec.md
├── EMAIL_19c6873649a1bfef.md
├── ... (10 email files total)
```

**File format:**
```markdown
# Email: [Subject]
- **From:** [Sender Name] <email@domain.com>
- **Date:** 2026-02-16 23:24
- **Status:** Unread

## Summary
[Gmail snippet text]
```

#### Operational Modes
- `--once` flag: Single fetch and exit
- Default: Continuous polling every 120 seconds (`POLL_INTERVAL`)
- Deduplication: Skips emails already saved (checks by message ID filename)
- Error resilience: Catches exceptions and retries on next poll cycle

### 2. Emails Successfully Captured

| Sender | Subject | Priority |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Hamza Naeem (LinkedIn) | I want to connect | HIGH |
| Binance | Something special is coming this Ramadan! | HIGH |
| GoDaddy | Your cart's rolling away | HIGH |
| GoDaddy | Important: We've updated our terms | MEDIUM |
| LinkedIn Job Alerts | Detecting AI is hiring in Pakistan | MEDIUM |
| Expo Team | Ready to test on real devices? | MEDIUM |
| Claude Team | Welcome to Claude Code | MEDIUM |
| Haseeb Ur Rehman (LinkedIn) | Accepted your invitation | LOW |
| Ayesha Abdulhakeem (LinkedIn) | Accepted your invitation | LOW |
| Canva | Generate the perfect video for your project | LOW |

### 3. CEO Briefing Generation (`CEO_Briefing_Feb_17.md`)

The Gmail Bridge data feeds into a cross-folder analysis that auto-generates the Monday Morning CEO Briefing. This briefing combines:

- **Inbox Intelligence:** Prioritized email table (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- **Desktop & Local Tasks:** Extracted from Desktop_Log.md and detected files
- **AI Recommendation:** Actionable next steps ranked by urgency

## OAuth Setup Steps

1. Created a project in Google Cloud Console
2. Enabled the Gmail API
3. Created OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Desktop application)
4. Downloaded `credentials.json` to `watchers/`
5. First run triggered browser-based Google sign-in
6. `token.json` was cached for future authentication
