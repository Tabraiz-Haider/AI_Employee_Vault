## Prompt Given

> Create a new script named `agent_brain.py`. This script should:
> 1. Read all markdown files in the `Readings/` folder.
> 2. Look for any email that has 'Status: High' or 'Priority: High'.
> 3. For every High priority email, automatically create a new file in the `Tasks/` folder named `AI_TASK_[Subject].md`.
> 4. Inside that file, write: 'AI has detected this as urgent. Suggested action: [One line action].'
> 5. Log this step in `prompt_history/step4_agent_brain.md`.

## What Was Built

### `agent_brain.py` — Autonomous Task Generator

A standalone Python script that cross-references two data sources to detect high-priority items and auto-generate actionable task files.

#### Data Flow

```
Readings/EMAIL_*.md  ──┐
                       ├──> agent_brain.py ──> Task/AI_TASK_*.md
CEO_Briefing_Feb_17.md ┘
```

#### How It Works

1. **Parse CEO Briefing:** Extracts the Inbox Intelligence table using regex, filters for rows where Priority = `**HIGH**`
2. **Parse Email Files:** Reads all `EMAIL_*.md` files in `Readings/`, builds a lookup dictionary keyed by subject
3. **Cross-Reference:** Matches each HIGH priority item from the briefing to its source email file via fuzzy subject matching
4. **Generate Tasks:** For each match, creates `AI_TASK_[Subject].md` in `Task/` with:
   - Priority, sender, detection timestamp, source email filename
   - AI-generated suggested action (keyword-based matching)
   - Original action text from the CEO Briefing
5. **Deduplication:** Skips task files that already exist (idempotent — safe to re-run)

#### Keyword-Based Action Hints

The script uses a keyword dictionary to generate contextual one-line suggested actions:

| Keyword | Suggested Action |
|---------|-----------------|
| `connect` | Accept or decline the connection request promptly |
| `cart` / `order` | Complete the purchase or dismiss the cart before it expires |
| `ramadan` | Review the time-sensitive event and decide on participation today |
| `hiring` | Review job listings and apply to relevant positions |
| (fallback) | Review this item immediately and take appropriate action |

## Architecture Significance

This step implements the **"Brain"** layer of the Digital FTE architecture. The agent now autonomously:

1. **Perceives** — reads email data from the vault (Senses layer already done)
2. **Reasons** — identifies which items are urgent via priority analysis
3. **Acts** — creates structured task files with suggested actions

This transforms the system from a passive data aggregator into a proactive task-generating agent.

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.13
- `pathlib` for robust cross-platform paths
- `re` (regex) for markdown table and metadata parsing
- Keyword-based action suggestion engine

---

## How to Run

```bash
cd "C:\Users\Tabraiz Haider\OneDrive\Desktop\AI_Employee_Vault"
python agent_brain.py
```

Safe to re-run — duplicates are automatically skipped.

---

## Status

Complete. 3 HIGH priority tasks auto-generated from 10 emails. The Agent Brain is operational.
