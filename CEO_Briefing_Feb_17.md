## AI Recommendation

**Start with the time-sensitive items first.** The Binance Ramadan event launches tomorrow (Feb 18), so decide now whether you want to participate in the 7-day rewards campaign. Next, handle the GoDaddy cart — abandoned carts typically expire within 24-48 hours, so either complete the purchase or dismiss it. After that, accept Hamza Naeem's LinkedIn connection from CloudNeurix as networking with business development professionals aligns with growth priorities. The remaining LinkedIn notifications and promotional emails can be batch-processed later in the day. On the desktop side, clean up the test folders from Feb 11 if they are no longer needed, and organize the new watcher files created today.
